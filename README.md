#### Description:
This project is a simple currency converter that allows users to convert between five different currencies: Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), and Japanese Yen (JPY).

To use the converter, the user inputs the amount they wish to convert and selects the currency they are converting from and the currency they are converting to. The exchange rate is then calculated using the latest exchange rate data obtained from an external API. The converted amount is then displayed on the screen.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the Font Awesome 5.15.4 icon library and makes use of the fetch() method to retrieve data from the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangerate.host).

This project is intended to demonstrate the use of APIs and how they can be used to retrieve real-time data for use in web applications. It is also a good example of how to create a simple but functional currency converter using JavaScript.
