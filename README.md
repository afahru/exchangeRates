#### Description:
This project is a simple web application that allows users to convert currencies using real-time exchange rates. The user inputs an amount and selects the currency they want to convert from and the currency they want to convert to, and the application calculates and displays the result.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangerate.host) to retrieve the latest exchange rates for different currencies. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with two dropdowns for selecting currencies and two input fields for inputting amounts.
To use this application, simply select the currency you want to convert from and to, input the amount you want to convert, and click the "Calculate" button. The application will display the result below. You can also click the "Clear" button to reset the inputs.
