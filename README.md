#### Description:
Exchange Rates Project is a web application that allows users to convert currency values between different currencies. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application has a simple user interface that consists of two input fields for entering the amount and two dropdowns for selecting the currencies. The application also has a Calculate button to initiate the currency conversion and a Clear button to reset the input fields.

#### Files in the Project:
The project contains three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

The index.html file contains the HTML code for the user interface of the application. It defines the layout of the input fields, dropdowns, and buttons. It also includes the Font Awesome icon library and the style.css and script.js files.

The style.css file contains the CSS code for styling the user interface. It defines the fonts, colors, and layout of the application.

The script.js file contains the JavaScript code for implementing the currency conversion logic. It defines the functions for fetching the exchange rate data from the API, calculating the converted currency value, and updating the user interface with the result.

#### Design Choices:
When designing the Exchange Rates Project, I made several choices to enhance its functionality and user experience. Firstly, I chose to use the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangerate.host) to fetch the exchange rate data. The [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangerate.host) provides reliable and up-to-date exchange rate information for various currencies. Secondly, I chose to use the Font Awesome icon library to add icons to the application. The icons make the application more visually appealing and easier to use. Finally, I chose to use JavaScript to implement the currency conversion logic. JavaScript is a powerful programming language that allows for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

#### Conclusion:
Exchange Rates Project is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to convert currency values between different currencies. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangerate.host) to fetch the exchange rate data. The application has a simple user interface and is easy to use. By making design choices that enhance the functionality and user experience, the application provides a reliable and enjoyable currency conversion experience.
